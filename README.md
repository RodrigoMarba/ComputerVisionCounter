## Abstract

With the growing need for stricter production control and data-based management, which the fourth industrial revolution brought us, many traditional companies in the industrial sector began to encounter problems right at the first stage of the data-driven process, the collection.

In the installations of newer companies, mainly those with cash to make large investments, the machinery is already prepared to survey the main indicators of the process, and make the integration in an intelligent management system. "IoT" as it is commonly known or "The internet of things" in its literal translation is one of the main pillars of intelligent manufacturing, which besides bringing several benefits to companies that manage to implement this system, also brings a very big competitive advantage to be ignored.

In this context, the main problem for companies already established in the market is to be able to make the necessary collection, in machinery that does not have the technology to do this function autonomously, and that still has a useful life that does not justify the investment in refactoring part or all of the production line.

##### The purpose of this work in this context, is the development and implementation of an embedded vision system, using machine learning technologies and neural networks, to perform the capture and control, as well as the storage and distribution of production data in a integrated management system.
